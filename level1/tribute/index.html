    <h2>About Chaudhary Charan Singh</h2>
    <p>
      Chaudhary Charan Singh (23 December 1902 â€“ 29 May 1987) was an Indian politician who served as the 5th Prime Minister of India 
      from July 1979 to January 1980. Born in Noorpur, Uttar Pradesh, he emerged as one of the most prominent leaders advocating for 
      the rights and welfare of farmers. He played a key role in drafting and implementing land reform laws, aiming to dismantle 
      the zamindari system and empower small cultivators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known as the "Champion of Farmers," he spent decades shaping rural development policies and promoting agricultural self-reliance. 
      His political career included terms as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Union Home Minister, and Deputy Prime Minister. 
      Even after his tenure, his ideas continued to influence India's agrarian policies.
